Huggle is an anti-vandalism tool for use on Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects. This project contains the Huggle 3 beta. Huggle 3.0 is currently under development and there is no stable .exe version. If you are an advanced user you may compile the source code, but it is NOT recommended to use Huggle 3.0 on Wikimedia projects at the moment.
